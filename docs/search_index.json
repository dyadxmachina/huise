It will include the following &gt; the practices &gt; the principles &gt; the diets (information, knowledge, food, media) &gt; the investigations Our daily practices (philosophy in action) can be followed live here. here (Haohan) and here (Fanli) or on our LinkedIn’s here and here Also visit our new site ingey.life here For weekly updates please add your email below. #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } Email Address * As you read, consider that whatever you first think, is likely to be wrong, since you may have not pushed yourself far enough to the edge to see what it would make of you, so we encourage you to try such an experiment for 3 months. We will soon lay this out for those willing ot take such a challenge on. 0.1 disclaimers It is patchwork. Which means it changes as we do, and that can be quite frequent, even if you don’t zoom in. It is opinionated. The lines are drawn harshly but can be redrawn as more life is experienced or knowledge is gained. It is working. In this age of misinformation and the move towards more herd like behaviour, this has been an antidote. It is difficult. It isn’t easy giving up all the dopamine rushes you get from eating processed food or going out and drinking all night. It is broken. Any thumbnail photo of how to live suffers from incompatible with the true underlying complexity produced by living as social animals. Let us hope this suffers infinitesimally less. “I don’t know why we are here, but I’m pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.” - Wittgenstein “Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?” - Martin Heidegger “We are not here to follow or please the crowds, we are here in search for a way to carry our burden in a way that maximises the positive impact it has on living organisms. We are infinitesimal, but yet we have a life, thrown into the world as Heidegger might say, fortunate or not, we must muster the tireless questioning by way of experiment and empiricism as well as build on previous knowledge, though carefully. From it, we may derive, patch by patch, a way to shoulder our burden, always willing to start all over again. Why? To cut a path that is truly unique? For fame and/pr fortune? None of these reasons suffice. Because they lead to emptiness and a life filled with space. You must bring your on light and see what it does to the world. But your light cannot be gained by purely emulating others or following only what others tell you. You must gain your own light, that which others should intuitively feel is pointed elsewhere. So when you go out away from your group that kept you so safe, that you force yourself to adapt and begin to complete you, and just when you feel close to completion, you must start again. Patch by patch. Sharing your journey along the way.” "],
["intro.html", "1 Introduction to huīsè de 1.1 Just what is huīsè de system?", " 1 Introduction to huīsè de 1.1 Just what is huīsè de system? Let’s start with the definition, huīsè de - means grey or the grey, so it is the grey system. There is an intention there. Haohan and Fanli only where shades of grey. Why grey? 1.1.1 Grey The colour grey has been called boring. To be grey is to be bland. Like an overcast. To be lacking in colour or excitement. It might be said that grey doesn’t stand out but rather disappears from our view. A great system does just that. It is grey because it is an aesthetic that doesn’t scream for attention that we so often chase on social media platforms. Grey in a world of bright neon yellows and reds, may seem like a disadvantage, a way to go unheard. But, like many perceived disadvantages or constraints, adapt you in ways that benefit you in the long run. We are living in a 24/7 shouting war, where many have given up self-mastery and long term impact for short term views and likes on social media. Image of logo placeholder 1.1.2 Infinite Loop We find ourselves in an infinite loop dressing ourselves up for our social groups (some real, most imagined) in exchange for temporal approval to which our receptors have become so habituated that we are always in search for a greater high. 1.1.3 Data-Driven We have adapted. But are not anti-fragile. We have not found the answer, but we believe that we have discovered a system that will help us cut through the madness of modern life. We have gone through the tedious business of collecting data on ourselves that range from self-report to our psychophysiological signals and purchase history that we will release. 1.1.4 The Age of Maximum Entropy 1.1.5 The Pacifist and the Tyrant 1.1.6 A.I. and the Future We are both working in artificial intelligence, we have called ourselves towards the action to "],

["huise-de-practices.html", "4 huīsè de practices 4.1 Schedule - Ban Kaui 4.2 Clothing - Uniform 4.3 The 4 Diets (nutrition, sociality, media consumption, knowledge ) 4.4 Time 4.5 Depth and Breadth 4.6 Death 4.7 Data", " 4 huīsè de practices 4.1 Schedule - Ban Kaui 4.2 Clothing - Uniform We typically wear grey as much as possible and have a daily uniform that we wear every day. 10 grey pants 10 grey shirts 3 grey button ups 2 grey sweaters 2 grey pairs of shoes 4.3 The 4 Diets (nutrition, sociality, media consumption, knowledge ) Someone once asked why not maximize the amount of experiences and clothe yourself with diverse views from everywhere you can. It assumes that I will come back , many of those well travelled people have refined simplifications of huge 4.3.1 Nutrition Diet This is really the foundation of where huīsè de starts. You are a function of what you eat or at least in large Plant based No processed foods (very minimally) No condiments No oils or butters No restaurants / delis Meal prep (minimal preparation) Always bring your own plants food Nuts and beans No such thing as a cheat day Rewards are typically pistachios and other raw foods 4.3.2 Social Diet (solitary but social) leave most of social media and become a producer stop wasting time socialising and philosophising with friends, spend time building towards competence and then mastery your job is not to please people or be the most agreeable person in the room, in fact overcoming time-filling human relations will be the biggest challenge you face in the modern world that is hyperconnected value deep connections and do away with small talk and gossip be comfortable being disagreeable enough and you will only track those who intend to use your time well because they also intend to use their time well. we are in fact social animals, but that does not be sociality is intrinsically valuable, the orangtun is a good example of an intelligent animal that is minimally social and spend time alone or in very small groups, this is what you should strive for, a few deep relationships that come not from endless daily gossip but a shared mission to use life as a way of taking a set of existential questions to their end, in hopes of pushing what it means to be human forward. 4.3.3 Media Diet (lose your cellphone) we both don’t have a single cellphone we track social media usage outside of posting 4.3.4 Knowledge we’ve went through large bouts of consumption of books (600+), audiobooks, and lectures. We recommend knowledge consumption only at the rate to which you can practice and teach it to others. We went from trying to read 100 books in a year, to reading just 2-3. 4.4 Time Time is a construct. You never have enough it. This is only a half truth. We waste time because we don’t know how to use our time effectively. We spend our wasted time, helping others waste their own time, and we find ourselves lacking the depth we really care 4.5 Depth and Breadth Follow a question, not a domain. A question will take you on an adventure that can’t be captured by any of the categorical buckets of knowledge we’ve instituitionalised. Fanli followed the question of why do we constantly sacrifice our life and our time as if we have an endless amount. And more particularly, why do many accept that social relations is a worthy excuse to live pathologically. This lead him from anthropology, sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and now towards deep learning and mathematics Haohan followed the question why do many people who identify as female, value asethetic beauty as an ultimate capital and how does that effect the structure of a person living in the modern world, which has lead her through books and lectures on psychology, neuroscience, self-help and now machine learning and deep learning to try to create a different future. 4.6 Death the denial of death leads us to treating our time as if it is infinite and we could . Instead you should be a meiser with your time. You should consider it your utmost responsibility to make the most use of your time so that you can become useful to society. That means stop wasting most of it and put yourself on a schedule. That means calling time wasted exactly what it is. The time you put into mastery will increase your ability to impact not just those around you and in your immediate group, but society and furthermore the world. 4.7 Data Hone your gut intuition by immersing yourself in the data of your life.
