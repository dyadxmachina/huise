# Introduction to huīsè de {#intro}

## Just what is huīsè de system?

Let's start with the definition, huīsè de - means grey or the grey, so it is the grey system. There is an intention there. Haohan and Fanli only where shades of grey. 


> Why grey?

### Grey
Grey has been called boring. To be grey is to be bland. Like an overcast. To be lacking in colour or excitement. It might be said that grey doesn't stand out but rather disappears from our view. A great system does just that. It is grey because it is an aesthetic that doesn't scream for attention that we so often chase on social media platforms. Grey in a world of bright neon yellows and reds, may seem like a disadvantage, a way to go unheard. But, like many perceived disadvantages or constraints, adapt you in ways that benefit you in the long run. We are living in a 24/7 shouting war, where many have given up self-mastery and long term impact for short term views and likes on social media.

### Infinite Loop
We find ourselves in an infinite loop dressing ourselves up for our social groups (some real, most imagined) in exchange for temporal approval to which our receptors have become so habituated that we are always in search for a greater high.


### Data-Driven
We have adapted. But are not anti-fragile. We have not found **the** answer, but we believe that we have discovered a system that will help us cut through the madness of modern life. We have gone through the tedious business of collecting data on ourselves that range from self-report to our psychophysiological signals and purchase history that we will release.
 

### The Age of Maximum Entropy


### The Pacifist and the Tyrant
### A.I. and the Future
We are both working in artificial intelligence, we have called ourselves towards the action to 

# huīsè de principles
Here we will talk about abstracts from our empirical experience and the knowledge we have gained from studying human behavior (from  neuroscience to cognitive psychology) and applied statistics and computational social science.

# huīsè de elements
Here we will talk about how all of the practices are tied together to create the system.

# huīsè de practices
## Schedule - Ban Kaui
## Clothing - Uniform
We typically wear grey as much as possible and have a daily uniform that we wear every day. 

- 10 grey pants
- 10 grey shirts
- 3 grey button ups
- 2 grey sweaters
- 2 grey pairs of shoes


## The 4 Diets (nutrition, sociality, media consumption, knowledge )
Someone once asked why not maximize the amount of experiences and clothe yourself with diverse views from everywhere you can. It assumes that I will come back , many of those well travelled people have refined simplifications of huge

### Nutrition Diet

This is really the foundation of where huīsè de starts. You are a function of what you eat or at least in large

- Plant based
- No processed foods (very minimally)
- No condiments
- No oils or butters
- No restaurants / delis
- Meal prep (minimal preparation)
- Always bring your own plants food 
- Nuts and beans
- No such thing as a cheat day
- Rewards are typically pistachios and other raw foods

### Social Diet (solitary but social)
- leave most of social media and become a producer
- stop wasting time socialising and philosophising with friends, spend time building towards competence and then mastery
- your job is not to please people or be the most agreeable person in the room, in fact overcoming time-filling human relations will be the biggest challenge you face in the modern world that is hyperconnected
- value deep connections and do away with small talk and gossip
- be comfortable being disagreeable enough and you will only track those who intend to use your time well because they also intend to use their time well.
- we are in fact social animals, but that does not be sociality is intrinsically valuable, the orangtun is a good example of an intelligent animal that is minimally social and spend time alone or in very small groups, this is what you should strive for, a few deep relationships that come not from endless daily gossip but a shared mission to use life as a way of taking a set of existential questions to their end, in hopes of pushing what it means to be human forward.  

### Media Diet (lose your cellphone)
- we both don't have a single cellphone
- we track social media usage outside of posting

### Knowledge
- we've went through large bouts of consumption of books (600+), audiobooks, and lectures. We recommend knowledge consumption only at the rate to which you can practice and teach it to others. We went from trying to read 100 books in a year, to reading just 2-3. 

## Time
Time is a construct. You never have enough it. This is only a half truth. We waste time because we don't know how to use our time effectively. We spend our wasted time, helping others waste their own time, and we find ourselves lacking the depth we really care 

## Depth and Breadth
Follow a question, not a domain. A question will take you on an adventure that can't be captured by any of the categorical buckets of knowledge we've instituitionalised. 

Fanli followed the question of why do we constantly sacrifice our life and our time as if we have an endless amount. And more particularly, why do many accept that social relations is a worthy excuse to live pathologically. This lead him from anthropology, sociology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and now towards deep learning  and mathematics

Haohan followed the question why do many people who identify as female, value asethetic beauty as an ultimate capital and how does that effect the structure of a person living in the modern world, which has lead her through books and lectures on psychology, neuroscience, self-help and now machine learning and deep learning to try to create a different future.


## Death
the denial of death leads us to treating our time as if it is infinite and we could . Instead you should be a meiser with your time. You should consider it your utmost responsibility to make the most use of your time so that you can become useful to society. That means stop wasting most of it and put yourself on a schedule. That means calling time wasted exactly what it is. The time you put into mastery will increase your ability to impact not just those around you and in your immediate group, but society and furthermore the world.

## Data
Hone your gut intuition by immersing yourself in the data of your life.
