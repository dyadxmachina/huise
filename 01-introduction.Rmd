### Grey
Grey has been called boring. To be grey is to be bland. Like an overcast. To be lacking in colour or excitement. It might be said that grey doesn't stand out but rather disappears from our view. A great system does just that. It is grey because it is an aesthetic that doesn't scream for attention that we so often chase on social media platforms. Grey in a world of bright neon yellows and reds, may seem like a disadvantage, a way to go unheard. But, like many perceived disadvantages or constraints, adapt you in ways that benefit you in the long run. We are living in a 24/7 shouting war, where many have given up self-mastery and long term impact for short term views and likes on social media.
